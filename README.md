# SEI Project 3: The Fake MoMA Store

## Summary

Project 3:

 I built a Full-Stack MERN App using an Express API pulling from a Mongo database. I used React to display the client side front end. This pretend MoMA store allows you to shop for art and technology.

## Challenges
Deploying the App to Heroku and connecting my front-end code didn’t workout the way I wanted it to. I’m still trying to figure out why.
